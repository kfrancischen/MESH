### Package MESH
**M**ultilayer **E**lectromagnetic **S**olver for **H**eat transfer.

A program for computing electromagnetic far-field and near-field heat transfer for periodic, layered
structures, developed by Kaifeng Chen (<kfrancischen@gmail.com>) of the
[Fan group](http://web.stanford.edu/group/fan/) in the Stanford Electrical Engineering Department.
